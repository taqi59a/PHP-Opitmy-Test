# PHP test

I made some improvements to the code:

- Removed unnecessary complex singleton setups, simplifying testing and maintenance.
- Introduced dependency injection for the database connection to make the code more modular.
- Separated the handling of data from its presentation to improve readability and maintainability.
- Enhanced security by properly escaping outputs to prevent web attacks.
- Added comments throughout the code to help future developers understand and modify it easily.

The refactoring was based on the assignment requirements to not only clean up the codebase but also to apply best practices in PHP programming without changing the application's behavior.
